## üìñ Episode 1: Execution Context

üìå Execution Context in JavaScript
In JavaScript, everything runs inside an Execution Context. You can think of it as a sealed-off container where your code is evaluated and executed. It‚Äôs an abstract concept that holds information about the environment in which the current code is running.

The Execution Context has two main components:

1. Memory Component (Variable Environment)

    Stores variables and function declarations in a key-value pair format.

    This phase is also known as the Creation Phase.

2. Code Component (Thread of Execution)

    Executes code line-by-line.

    This is also referred to as the Execution Phase or Thread of Execution.

üîÅ Characteristics of JavaScript Execution
Synchronous: Executes code in the order it appears (line-by-line).
Single-threaded: Can execute only one task at a time ‚Äî there‚Äôs only one call stack.
